    <div></div><br>
    <p><strong> Why mosquitoes? </strong><p>
    <p> There are over 3xxx mosquito species on the planet, yet only yy species transmit pathogens to humans.  Help build knowledge of the distribution and abundance of mosquitoes to help identify mosquitoes in your community and take measures to protect yourself from mosquito-borne pathogens. </p>
    <p>Of the XX species 6 have been identified to transmit both human and wildlife pathogens. </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Southern House Mosquito (Culex quinquefasciatus) </li>
        <li> Yellow-fever Mosquito (Aedes aegypti) </li>
        <li> Asian Tiger Mosquito (Aedes albopictus) </li>
        <li> Floodwater Mosquito (Aedes vexans) </li>
        <li> Asian Rock Pool Mosquito (Aedes japonicus)</li>
        <li> Bromeliad Mosquito (Wyeomyia mitchelli) </li>

<h2> About The Project (Awareness And Prevention) </h2><br>
<h3> Worldwide info </h3><br>
<div> Over 100 million people are infected with Dengue virus in the tropics and subtropics every year. Recently Chikungunya virus, with arguably worse symptoms than Dengue spread globally and now Zika virus threatens Hawaii shores. Don't panic, it takes an infected person to move one of these viruses to Hawaii, but once here it is critical that mosquitoes don't bite the traveler and spark another epidemic. The best way to prevent this is to make mosquito clean up and awareness a regular part of life in Hawaii. The mosquitoes in Hawaii project's benefit is that it is another way to keep the problem top of mind and keep Hawaiians and visitors safe. </div>

<h3> iNaturalist ‘Mosquitoes in Hawaii’ Project </h3><br>

<div> There is an explosion of Community Science (aka ‘Citizen Science’) projects that engage people to help participate in the scientific process (from formulating questions to collecting data, analyzing data, and even helping disseminate results).  For mosquitoes, there are a growing number of tools and projects aimed at helping people become more cognizant of these wily insects as well as help people identify and avoid the few specie that are impacted by them.  The ‘Mosquitoes in Hawaii’ Project utilized the iNaturalist program to document mosquitoes. </div>


<h2> How To Get Started (Contribute) </h2><br>

<p> You, our citizen scientist, can help catch mosquito specimens for study and documentation.  In doing so you can help to build and share a knowledge base of mosquitoes around your neighborhood.  Identifying mosquitoes in your community and taking appropriate measures to protect yourself from harmful mosquitos will help to reduce the risk of mosquito-borne diseases. </p>
