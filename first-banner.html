    Why mosquitoes? (15-20 words)

    There are over 3xxx mosquito species on the planet, yet only yy species transmit pathogens to humans. Help build
    knowledge of the distribution and abundance of mosquitoes to help identify mosquitoes in your community and take
    measures to protect yourself from mosquito-borne pathogens.

    What you will gain?

    Learn which species you encounter in your neighborhood?
    Help grow and share knowledge
    Work with your community to reduce the risk of mosquito-borne disease
    Have fun


    So what?

    Malaria, largely confined to tropical and subtropical areas affects over ???? M people annually. Over yyy die.
    Mosquito-borne viruses are also a problem: Over 100 million people are infected with Dengue virus in the tropics and
    subtropics every year. Recently Chikungunya and Zika virus have emerged and spread. West Nile virus reached N.
    America in 1999 and has spread. Although once thought stamped out in much of the N. Hemisphere, new pathogens and
    the invasive mosquito species that spread them are changing their distribution putting more and more people at risk.
    Don't panic, protecting yourselves from vector-borne disease starts with awareness, taking personal protective
    measures and making mosquito clean-up a regular part of life.
