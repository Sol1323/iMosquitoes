            <p class="content-text">The Center for Conservation and Research Training at the University of Hawai`i and the Departments of Microbiology, Entomology and Genomics at the California Academy of Sciences are testing the feasibility of mosquito sampling by citizen scientists, focusing first on adult mosquitoes.</p>

            <p class="content-text">We have already collected over 1,000 photo-based records in the mosquitoes in Hawai`i project. While over 80% of these pictures are readily identifiable we do not have any genetic information on these mosquitoes.  With your help we will be able to begin to characterize the likely source of these invasive insects and equally importantly discover and document any interesting microbes that they may be harboring.</p>

            <p class="content-text">As an active participant in the Mosquitoes in Hawai`i project we realize you have already document mosquitoes in your home location including knowledge of the watery habitats where you may find larvae, eggs and adults. But we haven’t yet gotten any samples returned from these sites.  After you have collected locally if you have transportation and the interest we welcome collections from all over the islands.  Note that the further apart your samples are, the more likely we will recover variable genetic signals.</p>

            <p class="content-text">Each kit contains all you need to photo document any dead adult mosquito then save this mosquito in a pre-numbered bar-coded tube either RNA Shield (orange caps) or 80% Ethanol (green caps).  We are testing both types of preservative to see which ones work better when handled in the field and then returned via post. Below you will find listed all the materials provided as well as step-by-step instructions for sample return.</p>

          <div class="card__face card__face--back">
            <p class="content-text">As always, SAFETY first, the RNA Shield and 80% Ethanol are not especially toxic but also they are for children, please use gloves when handling and if you get any on you just wash off using soap and water.  For more information on each, please see the enclosed Material Data Safety Sheet.  Also, important, please follow good safety measures to avoid getting bitten, but when that pesky adult mosquito is trying to bite you, use the kit to capture it for science! Be advised we are testing out sample return and we really welcome your constructive feedback as we streamline the kits and directions. Thanks so much for your efforts!</p>
